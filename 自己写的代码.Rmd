This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
readLines(here("data","sub01.log")) %>%
  str_detect("RT") %>%
  which() -> table2_start

readLines(here("data","sub01.log")) %>%
  str_detect("Subject") %>%
  which() -> table1_start

table1_end <- table2_start-2
table2_end <- length(readLines(here("data","sub01.log")))

raw_text <- readLines(here("data","sub01.log"))

writeLines(raw_text[table1_start:table1_end],
here("output","sub01_table1.txt"))  
```

```{r}
NB <- function(filename,outputname) {
 readLines(here("data",filename)) %>%
  str_detect("RT") %>%
  which() -> table2_start

readLines(here("data",filename)) %>%
  str_detect("Subject") %>%
  which() -> table1_start

table1_end <- table2_start-2
table2_end <- length(readLines(here("data",filename)))

raw_text <- readLines(here("data",filename))

writeLines(raw_text[table1_start:table1_end],
here("output",outputname)) 
}
NB("sub02.log","sub02_table5.txt")

subs <- c("sub01","sub02")
for (i in subs) {
filename <- paste0(i,".log")
outputname <- paste0(i,"_tablenew.txt")
NB(filename,outputname)
}
```


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
